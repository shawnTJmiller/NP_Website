		</h2>
		<p>Though a short distance from the urban areas of Cleveland and
			Akron, Cuyahoga Valley National Park seems worlds away. The park is a
			refuge for native plants and wildlife, and provides routes of
			discovery for visitors. The winding Cuyahoga River gives way to deep
			forests, rolling hills, and open farmlands. Walk or ride the Towpath
			Trail to follow the historic route of the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal</p>

		<p>The Florida Everglades, located in southern Florida, is one of

			wetlands was a major part of a 5,184,000 acre watershed that covered
			almost a third of the entire state of Florida. The Everglades consist
			of a shallow sheet of fresh water that rolls slowly over the lowlands
			and through billions of blades of sawgrass. As water moves through
			the Everglades, it causes the sawgrass to ripple like green waves;
			this is why the Everglades received the nickname &#034;River of
			Grass.&#034;</p>

			mountain ranges, elaborate glaciers, rivers, deep forests, lush
			meadows covered with wildflowers during the summer, and over 300

		<p>Yosemite National Park vividly illustrates the effects of

			have resulted in a concentration of distinctive landscape features,
			including soaring cliffs, domes, and free-falling waterfalls. There
			is exceptional glaciated topography, including the spectacular
			Yosemite Valley, a 914-meter (1/2 mile) deep, glacier-carved cleft
